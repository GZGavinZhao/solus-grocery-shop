# Solus Grocery Store
Some unofficial 3rd party packages for Solus OS.

## Disclaimer

These packages are **not official**, they are neither supported nor endorsed by the official Solus devs or MSEdge devs. Do not ask for help in Solus's/Microsoft's help forum, instead create an issue [here](https://github.com/GZGavinZhao/solus-grocery-store/issues). 

I do **NOT** have the source code for Microsoft Edge. This installation file is created by simply decompressing official the .deb installation file and copying/assigning its contents to the right location(s) your Solus system.

## Installation Instructions

### Microsoft Edge (dev)

### 搜狗拼音(sogoupinyin)
